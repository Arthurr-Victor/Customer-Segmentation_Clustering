# Customer Segmentation: An Interesting Approach

## Introduction
This project aims to identify customer segments in a dataset using clustering techniques. By understanding customer behavior and preferences, businesses can tailor their products and services to meet the needs of their customers more effectively, leading to increased customer satisfaction and revenue.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is from a fictional retail company that sells various products. It includes information about customers, their purchasing behavior, and demographics. The dataset has been anonymized to ensure customer privacy.

Data Cleaning
Before starting the analysis, we performed data cleaning to ensure that the data is clean and optimized for further analysis. We removed duplicate records and handled any missing or null values. We also evaluated the relevance of each column and excluded any that do not add value to the analysis. In addition, we extracted relevant features that could potentially improve the predictive power of the dataset.

Outlier Detection
Outliers are extreme values that can significantly affect the results of data analysis and machine learning models. Therefore, we used the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and remove outliers. By doing so, we aimed to improve the quality of the dataset, making it more suitable for further analysis and modeling.

Data Preparation
We used label encoder and standard scaler to prepare the data for clustering. We also reduced the dimensionality of the dataset using principal component analysis (PCA).

Clustering
We used two popular clustering methods, Agglomerative Clustering and K-Means, to cluster our data into distinct groups. To determine the optimal number of clusters, we used the elbow method and silhouette score. Ultimately, we decided on using Agglomerative Clustering with K=3. This method proved to be the most effective in grouping our data into meaningful clusters, allowing for deeper insights and analysis.

Evaluating Clusters and Profiling
We evaluated the quality of the generated clusters and profiled them using various visualization techniques. The evaluation of clusters aimed to assess how well the algorithm has identified meaningful patterns in the data. On the other hand, profiling clusters allowed us to identify characteristics that distinguish each group from the others, enabling us to gain insights into the data. This step is crucial for decision-making processes, such as targeted marketing, customer segmentation, and product recommendation.

Conclusion
By using clustering techniques, we identified three distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior and demographics. We were able to profile each segment and gain valuable insights into their preferences and needs. These insights can be used by businesses to tailor their products and services to meet the needs of each segment more effectively, leading to increased customer satisfaction and revenue.
